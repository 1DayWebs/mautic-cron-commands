# Mautic cron commands

[commands.php] can be used in environments where you do not have SSH access to run the Mautic [command line] tool: [`console`](#references).

## Example

![pretty-list](/assets/pretty-list.png)

![pretty-output](/assets/pretty-output.png)

## Installation

1. Edit your local copy of [commands.php]
   1. Change the `$secretphrase` parameter in the script to a **_new_** secret phrase so only you will be able to run the commands.
    > [!WARNING]
    > **_DO NOT_** leave it as `mautibot_happy`
   1. Optional: ðŸŽ¨ replace `$logo` with another base64 encoded image string.\
   `base64 -w0 image.png`

1. Copy your modifed `commands.php` to the root folder of your Mautic installation via SSH terminal, (s)FTP upload or carrier pigeon.
    > [!TIP]
    > This is the same level as Mautic's `LICENSE.txt` file and the directory `app/`

## How to use

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD033 -->

When you open the URL, you are presented with a list of available commands. You can click on those to run the command, or use the Encoded URL link to a specific command in a cronjob/scheduler service, like [Jenkins].

### Interactively

1. Open the `commands.php` URL with your browser
    ```http
    https://mautic.example.com/commands.php?mautibot_happy
    ```

1. Optional. Append `&pretty` to the URL to display a logo and basic navigation
   ```http
    https://mautic.example.com/commands.php?mautibot_happy&pretty
   ```

### Cron jobs

1. Find the URL encoded link to a command
    ```http
    https://mautic.example.com/commands.php?mautibot_happy&task=mautic%3Acampaigns%3Atrigger
    ```

1. Request the URL
    ```crontab
    # min hr dom mth dow  command
    */15  *  *   *   *    curl -L http://mautic.example.com/commands.php?mautibot_happy&task=mautic%3Acampaigns%3Atrigger
    ```

    > [!TIP]
    > `curl` can also use this syntax:\
    > `curl -L 'http://mautic.example.com/commands.php?mautibot_happy&task=mautic:campaigns:trigger'`
<!-- > `curl --request GET 'http://mautic.example.com/commands.php?mautibot_happy&task=mautic:campaigns:trigger'` -->

### Basic output

The output from the script will be sent to the browser so you can see the results just as if you ran this `console` command from the shell.

```console
Executing console mautic:campaigns:trigger
 Triggering events for campaign 5
 Triggering events for newly added contacts
 2 total events(s) to be processed in batches of 100 contacts
  0/2 [>---------------------------]   0%
